// REMOVED: Legacy school permissions controller
// This file has been completely removed as part of cleaning up the broken school function permission toggle system.
// All school permission/feature restriction logic has been eliminated.
// Features are now controlled by a new superadmin-only toggle system that will be implemented separately.
